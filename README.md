## Progress report.

### Architecture 1

  At the beginning we created a table in excel in order to make it
convenient for us to design an instruction set. Next we started to analyze how
many commands and memory units we could have in 8-bit architecture. First,
we decided to have 8 (2^3) commands and 32 (2^5) memory units (commands or variables). The main reason was
to have the opcode described by 3 bits and the remaining 5 bits describing the
address of a certain memory unit containing command of the program or variable. With that architecture we started to design
all commands necessary for our limited functional machine. Our first 8
designed commands were LD, MOV, ADD, SUB, AND, OR, NOT and CLR (further down you can see commands dictionary).

### Architecture 2

  The second version of the instruction set design has changed
significantly. We decided to allocate 4 bits to opcode and the remaining 4
bits to address, because only 3 bits for commands were not enough for
the full performance of our machine. Additional 8 slots for commands we
used for 6 conditional commands, increment and decrement. These
conditional commands were IFE, IFB, IFL, IFN, IFP, IFV.

### Architecture 3

  Current version of instruction set design requires 4 bits for opcode
and 4 bits for operand address. In this design we saw that addressless
commands do not have operands and occupy too many slots for address
commands. We used one opcode for all adressless commands and
started to use bits for operand to find an exact command from the whole
list of addressless commands. We have 15 available address commands
(LD, MOV, JMP, AND, OR, ADD, SUB, IFE, IFB, IFL, IFN, IFV, 3 not
occupied opcodes, 1 opcode occupied by addressless commands) and
16 available (CLA, OFF, LST, RST, INC, DEC, NOT, 9 not occupied
codes) addressless commands. This architecture has great scalability
potential as we have the opportunity to add 3 additional address
commands and 9 additional addressless commands.

### Units description

**AC**

Accumulator is a register that performs the function of temporary local
storage

**DR**

Data register is used to load data from RAM and to upload data to RAM.

**CR**

Command register is used to store command code and therefore load it
to the microcontroller.

**IP**

Instruction pointer is used to store a pointer to the next command we
need to execute from RAM.

**AR**

Address register is used to push the address to RAM to upload some
data or to download.

**BR**

Buffer register is used for some arithmetical and logical operations.

**ALU**

Arithmetical logical unit. Performs arithmetic and logical operations. Has 4 one-bit registers
required to perform arithmetic, logical operations and conditional
expressions (NZOC flags).

Negative flag

If equals 1 then the result is negative, else positive.

Zero flag

If equals 1 then the result is 0, else not zero.

Overflow flag

If equals 1 then overflow had happened during the execution of the arithmetic
operation.

C flag

Used for arithmetic and logical operations.

**Microcontroller**

Decompiles, executes commands by turning on and off processor gates
(A1, A2, B1, B2, C1, C2, D1, D2, D3, I1, I2, L1, R1, R2).

**RAM**

Stores commands and variables. Our machine cannot recognize
variables and commands by itself, only the one who uses the machine
can determine which memory unit contains a variable and which
contains a command.

## Appendix 3

### Address commands explanation

**LD**

Loads data from RAM to AC pushing the address of the memory unit
containing the data through the AR.

**MOV**

Moves data from AC to RAM pushing the address of the memory unit the
data through the AR.

**JMP**

Jump. Changes IP to execute another command in the next cycle.

**AND**

Performs the AND logical operation using first operand from AC and
second operand loaded from RAM to DR.

**OR**

Performs the OR logical operation using first operand from AC and
second operand loaded from RAM to DR.

**ADD**

Adds the second operand to the first operand in AC, which was loaded
from RAM to DR.

**SUB**

Subtracts the second operand from the first operand in AC, which was
loaded from RAM to DR.

**IFE**

Conditional expression that checks if Z flag equals 1, and if it is, then IP
will be set to address specified in the last 4 bits, else IP did not change.

**IFB**

Conditional expression that checks if Z flag and N flag equals 0, and if
they are, then IP will be set to address specified in the last 4 bits, else IP
did not change.

**IFL**

Conditional expression that checks if N flag equals 1, and if it is, then IP
will be set to address specified in the last 4 bits, else IP did not change.

**IFN**

Conditional expression that checks if N flag equals 1, and if it is, then IP
will be set to address specified in the last 4 bits, else IP did not change.

**IFV**

Conditional expression that checks if V flag equals 1, and if it is, then IP
will be set to address specified in the last 4 bits, else IP did not change.

### Addressless commands explanation

**CLA**

Clears AC by pushing 0 to it.

**OFF**

Shut down the machine by stopping the execution cycle.

**LST**

Executes left shift binary operation.

**RST**

Executes right shift binary operation.

**INC**

Increments AC (AC = AC + 1).

**DEC**

Decrements AC (AC = AC + 1).

**NOT**

Executes NOT binary operation.
